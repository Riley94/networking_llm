Logic Flow:

1. nids initialized
    a. PacketCapture initialized
        i. packet queue initialized

    b. TrafficAnalyzer initialized
        i. flow timeout/stats initialized

    c. DetectionEngine initialized
        i. IsolationForest (need to change to autoencoder) initialized
        ii. signature rules set (not yet done)
    
    d. AlertSystem initialized
        i. Initialize logging, llm if available.

2. Load luflow data and train classification model, if needed.
3. Start nids
    a. choose network interface to capture packets on
    b. start packet capture
        i. start pyshark LiveCapture thread on given interface
        ii. check every thread call for stop request
        iii. only queue tcp/ip packets
    c. get next packet in queue
    d. analyze packets, retieving statistics until flow completion (needs review)
